 * The third argument to exec() is defined by the C library.  It is
 * documented here even though the kernel knows nothing about it.
 * Sue me.
 *
 * Three things need to be passed from the old instance of the
 * process to the new.  First, a command line, which is mapped into
 * the argc/argv format on the receiving end.  Second, the state of
 * the file descriptor layer.  Finally, the state of the mount table.
 * All data is passed in an mmap()'ed sharable region; all data is
 * packed together end-to-end.
 *
 * The command lines is passed as an unsigned long count, followed by
 * that many null-terminated strings.
 *
 * The file descriptor layer is passed as an unsigned long count of
 * the number file descriptors, followed by that many pairs of
 * <int, port_t>'s, indicating the association of a file descriptor
 * to a port.  Port state is then initialized as if this was the first
 * open on the file descriptor.  XXX it would be very ugly to pass
 * full state; would it be worth it?
 *
 * The mount table is passed as an unsigned long count of the number
 * of mount table slots.  Each slot is represented by an unsigned
 * long count of the number of entries under the slot.  Each entry
 * is a port_t, corresponding to an open connection to a filesystem
 * server.
