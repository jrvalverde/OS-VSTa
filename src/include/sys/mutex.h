/*
 * mutex.h
 *	Both sleep- and spin-oriented mutual exclusion mechanisms
 *
 * VSTa mutual exclusion comes in two basic flavors: spinlocks (lock_t)
 * and semaphores (sema_t).
 *
 * Spinlocks
 *
 * When a spinlock is taken interrupts may be
 * blocked (to protect resources shared between interrupt handlers and
 * non-interrupt code) or left unblocked (for resources accessed only
 * from non-interrupt code, but accessible from more than one thread/
 * CPU at a time).
 *
 * Spinlocks may nest, although nesting an SPL0 lock while holding an SPLHI
 * one will cause a panic.  All locks must be released before the CPU is
 * relinquished.
 *
 * Semaphores
 *
 * Semaphores are the only mechanism for sleeping.  When sleeping on
 * a semaphore, PRIHI will inhibit events from breaking the semaphore,
 * PRICATCH will allow events which show up as a non-zero completion
 * of the p_sema operation, and PRILO will cause the system call to return
 * with EINTR (p_sema never returns, a longjmp happens instead).
 *
 * You may transition from a lock to a semaphore using p_sema_v_lock.
 * There is no way to transition from one semaphore to another atomically.
