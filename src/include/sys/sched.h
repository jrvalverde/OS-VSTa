 * sched.h
 *	Data structures representing the scheduling tree
 *
 * CPU time is parceled out via a "tree" distribution.  Each
 * node in the tree competes at its level based upon its priority.
 * Once it has "won" some CPU time, it parcels this time down
 * to its members.  Leafs are threads, also possessing a priority.
 * The intent is that the CPU time is evenly distributed based on
 * the relative fractions of each candidate.  Thus, two processes
 * with a priority value of 20 each would get 50/50 CPU time.  A
 * 5:20 ratio would give the first 1/5 of the time, and the other
 * 4/5 of the time.
