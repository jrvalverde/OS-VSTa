 *	Data structures for swap manager
 *
 * The swap task simply manages one or more swap partitions,
 *
 * This manager is currently single threaded.  It will be appropriate
 * in the future to allow enough threads to queue I/O to each device
 * on which swap blocks reside in parallel.
 *
 * Offsets to this manager are in page-sized blocks.  Since byte offsets
 * are not needed, this allows us to potentially support very large
 * swap spaces.
