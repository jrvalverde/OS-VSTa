/*
 * vm.h
 *	Machine-dependent VM stuff
 *
 * Some basic facts to keep in mind.  On i386, a two-level page table
 * organization is used.  Each top slot (known as a level 1 PTE) points
 * down to a page of level 2 PTEs.  Each top slot is responsible for
 * 4 Mb of virtual address space; each level 2 PTE handles 4K of that.
 *
 * Our boot loader has arranged for the kernel text to reside at 0 (the
 * first page is invalid, so references to vaddr 0 will trap).  It has
 * filled in a couple slots of the L1PTEs, pushed the page frame number
 * (PFN) of the next free page on the stack, and called us.  See locore.s
 * for details on initial boot.
 *
 * On boot, the root page table is layed out as:
 * 0000: 1:1/text
 * 0001: data remapping
 * 0002: CR3 (so at 8 Mb you will see the page table memory linearly)
 * 0003: empty, but L2PTEs are present
 *
 * We convert slot 3 to be our utility mapping area.  We then map 0004 and
 * up to be a 1:1 mapping of all physical memory.
 *
 * To avoid the cost of swapping page table roots when entering the
 * kernel, we share a root page table with our user-mode threads.  The
 * user's segments are tweaked to map vaddr 0 to paddr 2 Gb.  The user's
 * stack(s) start at the top of his 2 Gb.  So indices 512 and 1023 of
 * our L1PTEs will be filled in.  Perhaps 513 and 1022, etc. if the
 * process is big enough.
