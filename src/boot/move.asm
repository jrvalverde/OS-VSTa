; move.asm
;	Move a block of memory and jump to it
;
; Tricky, since this code will get tromped unless it is moved
; up out of the way.  This then requires some care since the code
; isn't actually running at the address for which it was assembled.
;
; Once running, this code pulls what it needs from the rest of the
; DOS boot loader, then disables interrupt and bulk-copies the
; stuff down to a base address of 0 (actually 4K, since 32-bit tasks
; are generated with an invalid addr 0).  Finally, it launches the
; 32-bit code through the boot 32-bit task gate.
;
; This isn't easy, but that's why we get the big bucks, right? :-)
