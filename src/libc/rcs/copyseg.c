 * msg_receive()

 *
 * This routine is needed because msg_receive() can receive both segments
 * as well as copies of data into a directly-specified buffer.  We receive
 * a message, copy out any parts for which a buffer was directly specified,
 * fill in segment information for any remaining data, and then return
 * the message to our caller.
