/*
 * event.c
 *	Code for delivering events to a thread or process
 *
 * Both threads and processes have IDs.  An event sent to a process
 * results in the event being delivered to each thread under the
 * process.  An event can also be sent to a specific thread.
 *
 * A process has two distinct incoming streams
 * of events--a process-generated one and a system-generated one.
 * The system events take precedence.  For process events, a sender
 * will sleep until the target process has accepted a current event and
 * (if he has a handler registered) returned from the handler.  System
 * events simply overwrite each other; when the process finally gets
 * the event, it only sees the latest event received.
 *
 * t_wchan is used to get a thread interrupted from a sleep.  Because
 * the runq_lock is already held when the semaphore indicated by t_wchan
 * needs to be manipulated, a potential deadlock exists.  The delivery
 * code knows how to back out from this situation and retry.
 *
 * Mutexing is accomplished via the destination process' p_sema and
 * the global runq_lock.  p_sema (the field, not the function) is needed
 * to keep the process around while its threads are manipulated.  runq_lock
 * is used to mutex a consistent thread state while delivering the
 * effects of an event.
