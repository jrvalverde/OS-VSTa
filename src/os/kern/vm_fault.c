/*
 * vm_fault.c
 *	Routines for resolving VM-type faults
 *
 * Basic strategy behind handling of VM faults:
 * A fault initally happens in an address space (vas).  The appropriate
 * pview is found, and the affected slot within the pview's pset is
 * locked.  The pset's slot is then filled via the psop_fillslot function.
 * On success, the resulting physical page number is mapped via the
 * hat layer, and the fault returns success.
 *
 * The obvious errors (no pview for vaddr, slot couldn't be filled, etc.)
 * are handled.
 *
 * Each physical page points back to the pset using the page, and
 * the index within that pset.  All further state is kept in the
 * per-page struct "perpage".  This includes reference counting,
 * a record of the page's state (modified, referenced, etc.), and
 * a the head of a linked list of struct "atl"s.  The atl enumerates
 * the mappings which are active, each atl entry listing a pview,
 * an index, and a next pointer.
 *
 * In general, the reference count in the perpage reflects the number
 * of atl's hanging off the perpage.
 *
 * A pset which is a view of a file (via a port) has some unique needs.
 * A copy-on-write (COW) set which references a file may transfer from
 * the file's image to a private copy on write, but shares access to
 * the page until the write occurs (if ever).  COW sets are linked off
 * the master fill-on-demand pset mapping the file.  The perpage slot
 * under the COW set counts as a single reference, even though there is
 * no atl and the COW's perpage has a reference count of 0.
 *
 * This is an exception to the general rule noted two paragraphs back.
 *
 * Copy-on-write (COW) sets are tricky.  The affected slot in the cow pset
 * is locked first; then the psop_fillslot is called on this slot.  Within
 * this cow slot filling, the slot of the master set is locked, and a
 * further psop_fillslot is invoked.
 *
 * XXX move some of this discussion to where it belongs--pset.c maybe?
 * XXX yeah, well, maybe, but at least it's a little bit correct now.
