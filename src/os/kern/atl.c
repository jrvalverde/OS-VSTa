/*
 * atl.c
 *	Routines for maintaining attach lists
 *
 * To implement a two-handed clock paging algorithm, you need to be
 * able to enumerate the translations which are active on a physical
 * page.  This is done using a couple levels of back links.  The
 * core entry points back to the "master" pset's slot using c_pset
 * and c_psidx.  Each slot in the pset holds a linked list of attached
 * views, starting at the p_atl field.  Finally, each COW pset can be
 * enumerated via the p_cowsets field.
 *
 * Mutexing of the p_atl field is provided by the slot lock for the
 * slot in the pset.  Mutexing for the c_pset/c_psidx is done using
 * the lock_page() interface.
