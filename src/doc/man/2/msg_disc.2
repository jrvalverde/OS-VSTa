DESCRIPTION
.br
.in +6
.ul 1
msg_disconnect()
causes a port to close.  When applied to a server's port, each client
will receive an I/O error on their next attempt to use the port.  If the
client already has an I/O outstanding, it will be completed in error
immediately.
.sp
When used by a client, a
.bd 1
M_DISCONNECT
message is queued to the server.  The server may clean up any
data structures, but does not need to reply.  The client has already
been disassociated from the port.
