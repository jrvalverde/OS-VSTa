DESCRIPTION
.br
.in +6
The
.ul 1
msg_connect()
system service connects a client to a server.
.ul 1
pn
specifies the server which passed this value
in its call to
.ul 1
msg_port().
.ul 1
mode
is passed to the server, and specifies the type
of access requested.  By convention, these bits
are defined in
.bd 1
<sys/fs.h>
and include:
.sp

.sp
A connection attempt is synchronous; this call will not return
until the server has received the call, processed it, and
responded with either a
.ul 1
msg_accept(), msg_err(),
or terminated due to an explicit
.ul 1
exit()
or an unhandled event.
