SYNOPSIS

int msg_reply(long sender, struct msg *msg);

DESCRIPTION
.br
.in +6
.ul 1
msg_reply()
is used by a server to answer a request made by a
client using
.ul 1
msg_send(),
and received in this server via
.ul 1
msg_receive().
.ul 1
sender
should be the value taken from the
.ul 1
m_sender
field of the received message.  Like
.ul 1
msg_send(),
a message with optional segments may be sent back.  Note
that if the client did not specify
.bd 1
M_READ,
the segments will be verified, but not actually transferred.
.ul 1
m_arg
should be the number of bytes in the reply.
.sp
The client is blocked until this reply is sent.  Thus, servers providing
access to "slow" I/O (keyboards, RS-232) will often record the
.ul 1
m_sender
field, and delay the sending of a reply for extended periods of time.
