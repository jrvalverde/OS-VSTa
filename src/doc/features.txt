Features by release:

v1.3.2:

Added TCP/IP networking with KA9Q package.
Added ne2000 ethernet interface server.
Added shared libraries.
Enhanced RS-232 so you can set parity, data bits, and so forth.
Added ps(1) command, via the pstat system call interface.
Added CDROM filesystems.
Converted all servers to use syslog.
Port of "vim" vi clone editor.
Floppy driver now works.
i387 FPU supported by kernel--library support still TBD.

v1.3.3:

/proc filesystem, ps(1) uses this, as does kill(1).
Canonical ("line") input mode has command line editing and history.
Stripped a.out format uses one less block, in general.
Fixed ld(1) bug which broke code living in the last 32 bytes of
	an a.out image.
Add cc(1) compiler, based on lcc compiler.  Fast, simple, lousy
	code generation.
More support of read-only files in dos filesystem.
Greatly improved stat(2) emulation.
Major fixes in permission calculations.  Now works pretty much like
	it was originally described.
Fixed namer to allow logins (actually, access to fs/root entry
	for shlib startup) from other than sys.sys capability.
Performance tweaks for vstafs.
Removed various dead code, added more pstat(2) support for kernel
	config values.
Added $s/$S to adb to allow incremental symbol table loading (so you
	can "$s /vsta/lib/libc.shl" and get shlib symbols).
Allow VM page stealing to be active before swap space is configured.
	Only stealing of unmodified pages is possible, but this can
	still be a help on smaller systems.
Port of "rh" find(1)-like tool using C syntax.
Add ~ and ~user processing for open()
