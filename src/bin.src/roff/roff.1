NAME
     tpr - text processor

SYNOPSIS
     tpr [ options ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     Tpr formats text according to control lines embedded in the
     text in the given files or standard input if none is speci-
     fied.  Input consists of intermixed _t_e_x_t _l_i_n_e_s, which con-
     tain information to be formatted, and _r_e_q_u_e_s_t _l_i_n_e_s, which
     contain instructions about how to format it.  Request lines
     begin with a distinguished _c_o_n_t_r_o_l _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r, normally a
     period.  Output lines may be _f_i_l_l_e_d as nearly as possible
     with words without regard to input lineation.  Line _b_r_e_a_k_s
     may be caused at specified places by certain commands, or by
     the appearance of an empty input line or an input line
     beginning with a space.

     The capabilities of tpr are specified in the attached
     Request Summary.  Numerical values are denoted there by n or
     +n, titles by t, and single characters by c.  Numbers
     denoted +n may be signed + or -, in which case they signify
     relative changes to a quantity, otherwise they signify an
     absolute resetting.  Missing n fields are ordinarily taken
     to be 1, missing t fields to be empty, and c fields to shut
     off the appropriate special interpretation.

     Running titles usually appear at top and bottom of every
     page.  They are set by requests like

               .he 'part1'part2'part3'

     Part1 is left justified, part2 is centered, and part3 is
     right justified on the page.  Any % sign in a title is
     replaced by the current page number.  Any nonblank may serve
     as a quote.

     The options currently available are:

     d         print directives encountered in input on diagnos-
               tic output (debugging only).

     efile     divert error messages to "file".

     i[index]  open the index file (see .rf directive), default
               name is "index".

     nN        number first page N (default 0).

     sN        stop after every N pages (default 1) and wait for
               newline from terminal iff output is to terminal

               device.  There is no initial pause.

     In addition, "-" in the input file list indicates that stan-
     dard input is to be opened and read.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Of course!

AUTHOR
     Many people have worked on the ancestors of tpr, known by
     names such as runoff, roff, etc.  Ken Yap ( University of
     Sydney ) can only claim credit for rewriting it in C.

BUGS
     Tpr may produce output too rapidly for people used to slower
     formatters.

     Although tpr is written in C, it will probably be utterly
     frozen because of the archaic convention of control lines
     and text lines and paucity of structured directives.
