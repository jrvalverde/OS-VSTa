Welcome to SCSI/CAM for VSTa.

This file contains a short description of the VSTa CAM environment,
instructions for configuring the driver, and a list of the source files
associated with the VSTa SCSI/CAM driver.

Except where noted in the source code and/or in this file, the
VSTa SCSI/CAM driver was written from scratch by Mike Larson
(larz@world.std.com). The following notice applies to all files

Revision History
----------------

VSTa 1.3.2

	Add CDROM support.

	Make libcam.a - a library of functions that can be used
	by user code to format CCB's and CDB's.

	Add pass-thru code. This code allows CCB's and CDB's
	received from an application to be sent directly to
	peripheral devices.

	Move VSTa specific code out of peripheral device drivers.

	Some changes to the Adaptec 1542 driver, including the
	addition of bounce buffers for support of systems with
	greater than 16MB memory (this code is currently turned
	off, however), disabling of the extended BIOS (if enabled),
	support for no-bus-reset-on-boot etc. Note that adaptor
	autosense has been disabled to support REQUEST SENSE
	operations from the peripheral drivers.

	Some bug fixes and code clean up.

VSTa 1.3

	Add a generic peripheral driver to give limited support to
	not-yet-supported devices.

	Move/conditionalize disk specific code.

	Modify the peripheral disk driver to use the new libdpart
	library. Remove fdisk.c.

	Convert to syslog interface.

VSTa 1.2

	Initial revision of VSTA SCSI/CAM driver.


What is CAM?
------------

From the SCSI FAQ:

	QUESTION: What is CAM?
	ANSWER From: ctjones@bnr.ca (Clifton Jones)
	====
	
	Common Access Method.
	
	It is a proposed ANSI standard to make it easier to program
	SCSI applications by encapsulating the SCSI functions into a
	standardized calling convention.

In CAM, the disk and tape drivers are called peripheral drivers (PDRV's
for short). At the top, PDRV's system level interface similar to that
of any other device driver in the operating system
(open/close/read/write/ioctl entry points for *nix, for example).
PDRV's do their job by sending SCSI commands down to the next CAM
layer, called the transport (or XPT) layer. The commands are contained
in a data structure called a CCB (CAM Control Block).

One of the jobs of the XPT layer is to route requests from the PDRV's
above to one of the SCSI Interface Modules (SIM's) below.  There may be
more than one SIM per system.

SIM's contain HBA (or dumb SCSI chip, etc.) specific code. The 154x
code is a SIM module, for example.


Quick VSTa SCSI/CAM Description
-------------------------------

The VSTa SCSI/CAM driver is loosley divided into three parts: code that
is relatively generic, code that is specific to VSTa, and hardware
specific code.

The generic code is simply a library of functions which may be called
by, or which may call functions in the VSTa code. The generic functions
include open/close/read/write/ioctl PDRV functions, most of the XPT
layer, and the "top part" the SIM layer (schedule the next request,
start a request, complete a request).

The VSTa specific code is responsible for sending and receiving
messages, interfacing with the operating system, dispatching to the
appropriate CAM code, and various utilities.

The hardware specific code is the "bottom" part of the SIM layer, which
interfaces to host adaptor hardware. Note that an attempt has been made
to package the necessary VSTa interfaces in a different module. This
may ease ports of drivers for host adaptors not currently supported by
VSTa.


Configuring the Driver
----------------------

The following explains how to get VSTa to "see" a root DOS filesystem
on a SCSI disk.

	Add or uncomment the following. This must go before the
	'DOS filesystem' section:

		# Adaptec 1542b/c SCSI disk support
		cam

	Add or uncomment the following in the 'DOS filesystem' section:

		# If your filesystem is on a SCSI disk, you might use:
		dos -p cam:sd0_dos0 fs/root

Note that 'sd0_dos0' is disk (target) 0 partition 0.  Substitute the
appropriate disk and partition numbers for other disk/partition
combinations.  For example, 'sd0_dos1' is disk 0 partition 1.

The SCSI/CAM server accepts the following command line options:

	-nobootbrst		don't do a SCSI BUS RESET during
				bootstrap initialization.

	-d N			sets the debug flags (see cam.h).
				'N' is either a decimal integer or
				a hexadecimal integer (with a leading
				"0x").
