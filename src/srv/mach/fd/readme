the core features:

	basic server framework
	support for 1.2MByte drives
	state machine operation

The code was extended in mid 1994 by Dave Hudson to add some extra features:

	support for 82077 type controllers
	support for 360k, 720k, 1.44MByte and 2.88MByte drives
	write protection checks
	diskette change checks
	user defineable media parameters
	various "stat" parameters added
	support for different media types in a given drive
	autoprobing of media types

The optional parameters are as follows:

	baseio=<I/O-base-address>
		- sets the base I/O address used by the FDC

	dma=<DMA-channel>
		- sets the DMA channel numner for the FDC

	fdc=<FDC-type>
		- forces the system to assume a particular type of FDC

	irq=<IRQ-number>
		- sets the Interrupt Request line used by the FDC

	namer=<namer-entry>
		- sets the name used to register the server with VSTa's
