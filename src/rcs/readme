@This is VSTA, the Valencia Simple TAsker.

Well, with VM, SMP, processes, threads, and messaging it isn't as
simple as I envisioned it when I made up the name, but there you
are.

This software was written from scratch entirely by:

	Andrew Valencia
	815 Maple St.
	San Mateo, CA  94402
	(415)343-6758
	vandys@@cisco.com

and is copyright 1993,1994,1995 by Andrew Valencia.  Use of this software
is permitted under the terms listed in the file "license", which
should accompany this file at the top level of the software
distribution.  If it is missing for any reason, you may contact
Andrew Valencia directly to receive a copy.

There are a couple source files which are not original; they are
identified in their headers, and are used and available under the
terms expressed by the original author.  From memory, they are:

	The i386 disassembler
	The random number generator
	The scanf() family of functions
	Several commands/utilities which have been ported:
		GNU C, gas, ld, rc, cat, Microemacs

This list is not necessarily complete; refer to the actual source
files.

In addition to the requirements spelled out in the license, I also
specifically require that any distribution of this software include this
file, and the "license" file.  I have not placed those noisy copyright
headers into each and every file, so I am counting on the Berne (sp?)
Convention and the presence of the "readme" and "license" files.
